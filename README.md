Precise Covid19 is a mobile application that helps users perform virtual COVID-19 risk tests, interact with Chatbot, and also check for the availability of protective gear like masks, sanitizers, gloves, etc. from the nearest pharmacy in MapView. For the prediction, it uses a deep learning model developed using TensorFlow. To make this model work on Android devices a light version was used by making use of TFLiteConverter. . It also makes use of the Google Firebase database and Google text-to-speech API.

This is one of my Hackathon projects conducted by IBM and NASSCOM titled 'Crack the Covid-19 Crisis’ – National Online Hackathon.

Some of the features are:
- Virtual COVID Risk Test (Deep Learning Model)
- Virtual Assistant (IBM Watson Chatbot)
- Check for Availability of essential items (Google API for MapView)
- Covid Info, Entertainment section, Emergency call, etc.
